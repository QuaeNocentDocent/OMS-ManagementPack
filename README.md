# OMS-ManagementPack
A monitoring OpsMgr management pack to remotely check OMS performance and availability.

Currently the management packs monitor:

1. [Operational Insights](https://github.com/QuaeNocentDocent/OMS-ManagementPack/wiki/Operational-Insights)
2. [OMS/Azure Automation](https://github.com/QuaeNocentDocent/OMS-ManagementPack/wiki/Azure-Automation-Monitoring)
3. [OMS/Azure Backup](https://github.com/QuaeNocentDocent/OMS-ManagementPack/wiki/Azure-Backup)

Please consider these management packs are under constant review and at the moment upgrade compatibility cannot be guaranteed for future releases. Documentation is at a bare minimum, KB articles maybe missing.
Any contribution is warmly welcomed.
